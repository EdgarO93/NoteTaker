## Description
Application that can be used to write and save notes using Node.js and Express. It was deployed on the Heroku app. I enjoyed working on it while building up on my back end coding skills. Building the routes and parsing the JSON data was challenging. I was able to use Insomia to test out the routes before deploying. I think for my next version, I would like to alter the design of the site and allow the notes to be edited after saving.
